# Overcast

Adds a volume slider to the browser version of [Overcast.fm](https://overcast.fm).

Install using a Userscript management browser extension such as [Greasemonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey) (Firefox) and [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) (Chrome).

Once one of the above extensions is installed, you can [click here](https://github.com/brycehebert/userscripts/raw/master/overcast/overcast.fm.user.js) and you should be prompted to install the Userscript.
